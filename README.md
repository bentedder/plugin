Boilerplate plugin/component in javascript
==========================================

This package should include a base structure, gruntfile, testing suite (jasmine), etc. for starting a project. Nothing fancy.

* Tests run in jasmine
* Grunt watches for changes in .js files or spec files and runs jasmine in command line
* bower.json and package.json files for dependencies

## Install Dependencies
Run `bower install` and `npm install` to get all dependencies.
